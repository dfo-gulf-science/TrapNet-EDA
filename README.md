# TrapNet Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploring archived and current data to see if we can match biological samples with normal specimen within our database.

NOTE: Initially, I referred to biological detailing specimen as 'historical' based on the nature if this data analysis task. However, 'biological detailing' is a more apt name (or 'bio' for short), so I have switched. However, 'hist' and 'historical' remain throughout the analysis (e.g., 'hist', 'n_hist', 'df_hist'), where they refer to the biologicaldetailing table.

# Summary of Analysis

### Main Workbooks
* <a href='https://github.com/KevinCarr42/TrapNet-EDA/blob/master/TrapNet_Preliminary_Analysis.ipynb'>Preliminary Analysis</a>: This analysis provided insights into data relationships, distributions, and potential issues. Preliminary versions of final analysis were tested, but not directly included in the final analysis. This workbook also contains some analysis that did not end up being useful, but was kept in the repository for posterity.
* <a href='https://github.com/KevinCarr42/TrapNet-EDA/blob/master/TrapNet_Prelim_Summary.ipynb'>Preliminary Summary</a>: Creation of a data summary file based on preliminary insights, which is used in findings and recommendations.
* <a href='https://github.com/KevinCarr42/TrapNet-EDA/blob/master/TrapNet_Findings_and_Recommendations.ipynb'>Detailed Findings and Recommendations</a>: In this workbook, all of the detailed analysis and recommendations were calculated. 
* <a href='https://github.com/KevinCarr42/TrapNet-EDA/blob/master/TrapNet_Summary_of_Recommendations.ipynb'>Summary of Recommendations</a>: This workbook summarises analysis and recommendations from the Detailed Findings and Recommendations workbook above.

### Miscellaneous Workbooks
* <a href='https://github.com/KevinCarr42/TrapNet-EDA/blob/master/Potential%20Import%20Issue.ipynb'>Potential Import Issues</a>: This workbook investigates a rare set of parameters that may lead to importing a biological detailing into the specimen table. This workbook demonstrates that there is likely no adverse affect due to this issue because none of the potential duplicates contain fork_length or weight information.
* <a href='https://github.com/KevinCarr42/TrapNet-EDA/blob/master/Improved_Matching_Algorithm.ipynb'>Improved Matching Algorithm</a>: This workbook is the rough calculations that lead to the binning and error calculating algorithm used to calculate the findings and recommendations.

# Summary of Findings
1. Data import into dm_apps was 1-1 with archived data.
    * All data imported exactly as expected with only 1 exception:
        * One import issue occurred when file_type == Null - these were classified as normal specimen even though many have sex info and all have age info
        * df_spec[df_spec.sex_id.notnull()]
            * 6 specimen in samples 4456 and 4475
	    * The only 6 specimen in this sample set that have sex data (though not in the entire database)
        * 150 total specimen have been imported under these conditions
            * It is unclear whether they are all bio, or not.
            * They are marked as either R or MZ, but the R (released unsampled) include sex and age data indicating that they may have been detailed
        * 0 or these potential import issues have fork_lenth or weight
            * Therefore, they will not be able to affect length or weight distribution calculations, even if they are in fact double-counted
2. Normal specimen (further referred to as specimen) and biological detailing specimen (bio) are differentiable by their fork_length distributions
    * Bio have mm resolution, whereas specimen are binned into 5mm bins (last digit is 3 or 8 in over 97% of samples)

3. A strong correlation between error tolerance and number of matchable samples was noted, likely due to the above bin resolution issue.
    * Further, this correlation was found to be almost entirely due to the bin size
    * For this reason, bins of width exactly == 5 (+- 2-3) were found to optimally match bio and specimen

4. Matching and comparing statistical distributions between bio and specimen did not correlate with projected matches because details distributions often vary significantly from the full sample.
    * This is not surprising, because detailing on a variety of fork_lengths is preferred

5. The implementation of a bin matching algorithm lead to the insight that left vs right inclusive bin edges significantly affected the number of exact matches

    * Using left inclusive bin edges (the default for matplotlib histograms), there were 203 fully matched samples (all bio within specimen bins)
    * Example:
        * Out of 793 samples this equates to 26% match rate, compared to less than 3% expected by chance
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94803263/224031503-b53c552e-78dc-4c61-b0ec-5389037e9938.png)
    * Using right inclusive bin edges (the default for pandas .cut()), there were 534 fully matched samples
    	* Out of 793 samples this equates to 67% match rate, compared to less than 3% expected by chance
	* Example:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94803263/224031404-d416c7ad-f0e4-4056-a144-78d76f4055a3.png)
6. In addition to exact matches, there were a number of samples where matches could be entirely ruled out:
    * Samples with no specimen, only bio
    * Samples with more bio and specimen
    * Samples with a high degree of error (number of bin offsets/errors required to assume match between bio with specimen)
7. Overall, recommendations were made for 604 out 793 samples (approximately 76%).
    * The remaining samples are ambiguous and do not appear to have enough evidence to deduce whether or bio are included within the specimen or not
